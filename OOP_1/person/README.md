# üë• Person-Student-Teacher Class Hierarchy in C++

This project demonstrates a simple class inheritance and polymorphism hierarchy in C++.  
It implements three classes: `Person` (base class), `Student`, and `Teacher` (derived classes), showcasing constructors, destructors, virtual functions, and memory management.

## üìå Overview
The `Person` class contains basic personal information fields such as name, age, and education.  
`Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `Person` and add their own specific fields and methods.  
Virtual functions enable polymorphic behavior, allowing overridden methods to print detailed information.  
Dynamic memory management is demonstrated via heap allocation and proper use of virtual destructors.
