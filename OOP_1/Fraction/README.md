# üßÆ Fraction Class (Basic Arithmetic and Comparisons)

This project implements a **Fraction** class in C++ for representing rational numbers and performing basic arithmetic operations and comparisons:

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Comparison operators: `<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`

## üìå Overview
The `Fraction` class allows creating fraction objects and performing arithmetic operations while automatically simplifying the results.  
It also supports comparison operators by converting fractions to their decimal representation for accuracy.

## üìÇ Files
- `fraction.h` ‚Üí Class declaration (header file)  
- `fraction.cpp` ‚Üí Class method definitions (implementation)  
- `main.cpp` ‚Üí Demonstration of class usage  
- `Makefile` ‚Üí Build automation  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or later (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)  
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows  

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### üõ†Ô∏è  1. Build the project
```bash
make
```
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  2. Run the Program
Execute the compiled file:
```bash
./main.exe
```
### üëÄ 3. View the Output  
After running the program, you will see the results of arithmetic operations on fractions, along with comparison outcomes, printed to the console.

--- 
## üìã Example  

When you run the program, it demonstrates arithmetic operations and comparisons between two fractions:
```
add
11/10
subtraction
-1/10
mult
3/10
division
5/6
n1<n2 : 1
n1>n2 : 0
n1==n2 : 0
n1!=n2 : 1
```

Here:
- `1` means **true**  
- `0` means **false**
